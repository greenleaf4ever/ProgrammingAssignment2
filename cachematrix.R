## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do
## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit 
## to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly 
## (there are also alternatives to matrix inversion that we will not discuss here). 
## Your assignment is to write a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.

## Write a short comment describing this function
## makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        i <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                i <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setInverse <- function(inverse) i <<- inverse
        getInverse <- function() i
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setInverse = setInverse,
             getInverse = getInverse)

}


## Write a short comment describing this function
## cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above.
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
## then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        i <- x$getInverse()
        if (!is.null(i)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(i)
        }
        mat <- x$get()
        i <- solve(mat, ...)
        x$setInverse(i)
        i
}
